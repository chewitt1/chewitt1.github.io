			<h3 class="sub-section-title">Historical Summary</h3>
			<p>In the two thousandth year of the Common Era, a girl child was born. While the time of this birth is wildy speculated and can be found in no official documents, it is known that the child was born on a small, scenic island. </p>
			<p>The child would go on to live in the continent of the North Americans where she now studies Computer Science at a university bearing name of the parish (or state as the North Americans call it) for which it is located. Many call it the "Home of the Gators" (for there are gators there but they speak of the Gator people not the gator animal) but its official name is the University of Florida.</p>
			<p>The child- now an adult- wishes to become a Software Developer- specifically one that creates enjoyable, user-centered products. As such she is honing her skills both in the back and the front end of software development. </p>
			<p>So how is that going for her? Read on to learn more</p>
