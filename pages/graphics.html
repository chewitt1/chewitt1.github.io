        <h2 class="sub-section-title">Mindful Consumption Series</h2>
        <p>Recently, I've increased my screen time by a lot, and decreased my outside time by a lot more- than usual (avid introvert here- like way too avid- it's a problem, really). 
           So I decided why not track my media consumption in a creative way while learning Graphic Design.</p>
        <div class="content">

			<h4 class="sub-sub-section-title">Reflection</h4>
			<p>Ok, ok, I know what you're thinking. Mine looks NOTHING like the original and I agree, but gimme a break alright? I'm learning. I'll be better... soon. When is soon? I don't know. I kind of have to learn other stuff like REST and Docker and Kubernetes and Sprint and AWS... you get- a lot of stuff.</p>
			<p>Anways, I'm kind of feeling it. I wouldn't post it if I was- also a perfectionist (not the perfect one- the self sabotaging one)</p>
